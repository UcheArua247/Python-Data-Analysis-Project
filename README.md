# Employee Attrition Data Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project explores and analyses an employee attrition dataset using Python, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.  
The goal is to understand what factors contribute most to employees leaving an organisation, and to visualise key patterns in the data.

## 📁 Project Files
- **Uche-AWDS5-009-Attrition Control Report)..ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis, visualisations, and insights.
- **TakenMind-Python-Analytics-Problem-case-study-1-1.xlsx**  
  Original dataset containing employee records and attributes.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project uses:
- Python  
- pandas — for data manipulation  
- matplotlib — for graphical visualisation  
- Jupyter Notebook — for interactive analysis

## 🧠 Key Analysis Sections
The notebook includes:
1. **Data loading & inspection** — checking columns and summary statistics.
2. **Data cleaning & preprocessing** — handling missing values and data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — visualising relationships between features and attrition.
4. **Insights & trends** — key factors associated with employee turnover.

## 📊 Example Insights (Summary)
- Departments or roles with higher attrition rates
- Relationship between tenure and likelihood of leaving
- Demographic trends related to employee retention
